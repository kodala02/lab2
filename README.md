# Weather App README

### 1. If you received a 401 status code in your API call, the most likely issue is with the API key. A 401 status code typically indicates an unauthorized request. To resolve this issue, the following should be checked:

- Ensure that you have a valid API key for the Tomorrow.io API and that it is correctly stored in the `apiKey` variable in your code.
- Double-check the API key for any typos or errors.
- Confirm that the API key is still valid and has not expired or been revoked.
- Make sure your API key has the necessary permissions to access the requested data from the Tomorrow.io API.

### 2. In this code, the design choices are minimal, and custom CSS styles have been used to structure the HTML elements and provide basic styling. The design choices are as follows:

- The background color of the body is set to `#f0f0f0`.
- The content is centered with `text-align: center` and has a margin of `0`.
- The main container has a white background with padding, border-radius, and a box shadow for a clean look.
- The title "Weather App" is styled with a font size of `28px` and a color of `#333`.
- Paragraphs are styled with a font size of `18px` and a color of `#555`.
- Form elements are centered within the container.
- Labels are styled to be bold and have a margin.
- Text input fields have a width of `100%`, padding, a font size of `16px`, and a border.
- The "Get Weather" button has a background color of `#007BFF`, white text, and a border radius. It changes color on hover.
- Messages for loading, temperature, and weather description are styled with colors and font weights.
